Prerequisites
--------------
- Anaconda installed
- Latest PHP installed
- A PoA ethernet has been setup and running on the computer


Requirements
-----------------
To test the universal wallet, the following need to be installed:
- [`bit`](https://ofek.github.io/bit/) Python Bitcoin library installed.
- [`web3.py`](https://github.com/ethereum/web3.py) Python Ethereum library installed.

If the bit, web3 or HD wallet is not installed, please see below on instructions to install.

********************************************************************************************************************************************
Installing web3 & bit
---------------------

Open a terminal and execute the following commands to install `web3.py` and `bit`, respectively. Windows users **MUST** use the _Anaconda Prompt_ in this section.

* Open the terminal and run the following command to create a brand new Python virtual environment for this unit.

  ```shell
  conda create -n ethereum python=3.7 anaconda
  ```

* Activate the new environment.

  ```shell
  conda activate ethereum
  ```

* Use the `pip install` command to download and install the `web3.py` module.

  ```shell
  pip install web3
  ```

  
* Use the `pip install` command to download and install the `bit` module.

  ```shell
  pip install bit
  ```

Verify Installation
--------------------------
Once the `web3.py` and `bit` modules are downloaded and installed, verify that both installations completed successfully. 
Windows users **MUST** use `git-bash` in this section.

* Use the `conda list package_name` command, substituting `package_name` with `web3` to verify if the `web3` library installed successfully.

  ```shell
  conda list web3
  ```

# packages in environment at C:\Users\sjeha\anaconda3\envs\ethereum:
#
# Name                    Version                   Build  Channel
web3                      5.20.0           py39hcbf5309_0    conda-forge

  

* Use the `conda list package_name` command, substituting `package_name` with `bit` to verify if the `bit` library installed successfully.

  ```shell
  conda list bit
  ```

# packages in environment at C:\Users\sjeha\anaconda3\envs\ethereum:
#
# Name                    Version                   Build  Channel
bit                       0.7.2                    pypi_0    pypi
bitarray                  1.2.2            py39hb82d6ee_1    conda-forge


Troubleshooting
-------------------------

It can be frustrating when packages do not install correctly, therefore use the below approaches to troubleshoot any installation or usage issues.

Install Microsoft Visual C++ Build Tools In Windows
---------------------------------------------------

In some cases, the `Web3.py` library may fail to install in Microsoft Windows due to the need for Microsoft Visual C++ Build Tools. In such an event, following the below steps to resolve the issue:

1. Go to: https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/

2. Scroll down the page and click on "Tools for Visual Studio 2019" to reveal the sub-options.

3. Download the "Build Tools for Visual Studio 2019" package.
    
4. Run the package file and select the C++ build tools option. Then click install.

5. This process takes about 15 minutes

Issues Installing `bit` or `web3` After Installing the Microsoft Visual C++ Build Tools In Windows
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Along the installation process of `bit` or `web3` you may experience an issue related with the Microsoft Visual C++ Build tools in Windows if you update Windows after installing the build tools, and before installing these Python libraries.

You may see an error message that states that `wheel is not supported`, the solution for this issue is to uninstall and reinstall the Microsoft Visual C++ Build Tools.

Update Conda Environment
---------------------------

An out-of-date Anaconda environment can create issues when trying to install new packages. Follow the below steps to update your conda environment.

**Important Note:** Windows users **MUST** use the _Anaconda Prompt_ to run these commands.

1. Deactivate your current conda environment. This is required in order to update the global conda environment. Be sure to quit any running applications, such as Jupyter, prior to deactivating the environment.

    ```shell
    conda deactivate
    ```

2. Update conda.

    ```shell
    conda update conda
    ```

3. Create a fresh conda environment to use with `web3` and `bit`.

    ```shell
    conda create -n ethereum python=3.7 anaconda
    ```

4. Activate the new environment.

    ```shell
    conda activate ethereum
    ```

5. Install the `web3` and `bit` packages.

    ```shell
    pip install web3
    ```

    ```shell
    pip install bit
    ```

******************************************************************************************************************************************
HD Wallet Installation
-----------------------------------

1. Begin by opening a fresh terminal. Windows users **must** open their terminal as administator as follows:

    * Input `C:\Program Files\Git\bin\bash.exe` directly into the system search bar and launch the program as _Administrator_ from the resulting menu. 
    
    * **This step is required or the installation will fail!**


2. With your terminal open as indicated for your operating system, cd into your `Blockchain-Tools folder and run the following code:

    ```shell
      git clone https://github.com/dan-da/hd-wallet-derive
      cd hd-wallet-derive
      curl https://getcomposer.org/installer -o installer.php
      php installer.php
      php composer.phar install
    ```

3. You should now have a folder called `hd-wallet-derive` containing the PHP library!

## Troubleshooting macOS hd-wallet-derive

If you run into an issue with the installation of `hd-wallet-derive` due to `php extension gmp` missing on macOS installation of PHP, here are the steps to resolve:

1. Run the command `brew unlink php@7.3` this unlinks the current version of PHP running on mac. 

2. Run the command `brew upgrade php@7.3` this will update your current version of PHP to the latest version of `php7.3.x`. 
  - If you receive the message that PHP `7.3.x` version is already installed proceed to the next step.

3. Run the command `brew link php@7.3 --overwrite` this will relink the corresponding path and connect the extensions (including gmp).

4. With your terminal open as indicated for your operating system, cd into your `Blockchain-Tools folder and run the following code:

    ```shell
      git clone https://github.com/dan-da/hd-wallet-derive
      cd hd-wallet-derive
      curl https://getcomposer.org/installer -o installer.php
      php installer.php
      php composer.phar install
    ```

Verification
--------------------------

1. Run the command to `cd` in your `hd-wallet-derive` folder.

2. Once you've confirmed your are in your `hd-wallet-derive` folder, execute the following command:

    ```shell
    ./hd-wallet-derive.php -g --key=xprv9tyUQV64JT5qs3RSTJkXCWKMyUgoQp7F3hA1xzG6ZGu6u6Q9VMNjGr67Lctvy5P8oyaYAL9CAWrUE9i6GoNMKUga5biW6Hx4tws2six3b9c --numderive=3 --preset=bitcoincore --cols=path,address --path-change
    ```

3. If installation was successful, you should see output similar to what you see:
